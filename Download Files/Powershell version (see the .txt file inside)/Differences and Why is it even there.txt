This version does not use async, so it has the same speed as just using winget
However it can do multiple things in one command
It's also better than winget because of nicely colored text and a few emojis in the output of the script
The only advantage compared to the rust version is how the output of the commands is displayed
This is here only because I created this script before the rust program
